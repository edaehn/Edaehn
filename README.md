### Hi! I am Elena. ðŸ‘‹

I like to travel, dance, read and think. My passion is to code and learn new things about life, nature, music, and technology. I have a work experience in teaching, coding, ERP support, and research. My PhD ([thesis](https://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/handle/10399/3987)) is in CS with a focus on adaptive web applications.

Recently, I have been programming in Python and discovering deep learning with TensorFlow. I think that AI is the future that we have to invest in while keeping humanity's needs in mind.

I share my thoughts and learning process at [daehnhardt.com](https://daehnhardt.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ElenaDaehnhardt). I look forward to new ideas, networking, and collaboration on exciting projects.
